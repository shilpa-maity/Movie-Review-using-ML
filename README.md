# Movies_Review_Classification_NLP

I implemented a Natural Language Processing based project. The project is Movies Reviews Sentiment Analysis who classify that the given review about the movie is a positive review or a negative review. So i train my model on the movies reviews dataset and use that model for implement end to end application. End-to-end means i deployed this model using the Python Framework flask on the localhost. And also deploy on the heroku. So i use a naive-bayes algorithm to train my model, this is probability based algorithm.
