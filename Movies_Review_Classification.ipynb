And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash\\'s screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.\\n\\nKGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky\\'s character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn\\'t really necessary).\\n\\nThe biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.\\n\\nOne thing I\\'d definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it\\'s an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022.\"\\n\" MASTERPIECE OF INDIAN CINEMA\\n\",10,DrRaj2012,14-Apr-22,\"\\n                    74 out of 90 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The first part was all about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.\\n\\nThe film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken down.\\n\\nThe story progresses at a brisk pace in a racy tale of Rocky\\'s journey to the top. The film, like the first part, presents a dark, dreary world that is stylishly shot. While the first part took time to prove who the protagonist was and included more time to establish the same, this second part moves quicker and one gets to meet more characters. The conflicts and battles are more interesting this time.\\n\\nThis film gets to showcase the emotional side of Rocky too, with a love story and even some glimpses into his past life that fuelled his ambition. The love story doesn\\'t take away too much from the tale either. One of the best shots in the film is the introduction of Adheera played by Sanjay Dutt. It is pure magic on screen and evokes whistles organically. Raveena Tandon as the Prime Minister also has a good track. The other interesting addition is Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer. Prakash Raj also makes for a good narrator, with his baritone adding an immersive experience.\\n\\nThe film belongs as much to filmmaker Prashanth Neel as it does to Yash. Both of them have managed to deliver a sequel that seems more immersive than the first part. Albeit, Prashanth has always maintained that the second part had the bigger chunk of his original story when they decided to break it into two parts.\\n\\nFor the audience who wants to watch a loaded action film with style, heavy-duty stunts, and dialogues, this one is simply made to order. KGF: Chapter 2 might not appeal to the seemingly woke audience, who would question consent or nitpick on commercial staples like violence. But for those who love such films, here\\'s an essential spoiler, as there is a hint at a possible third chapter in the end credits, so wait until the end.\"\\n\" KGF is KANNADA\\'s GOLD FILM\\n\",9,PavanKV,14-Apr-22,\"\\n                    55 out of 70 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

KGF Chapter 2 is a blistering, adrenaline-pumping, high-stakes sequel to what was an era-defining part 1 that propelled not just Prashant Neel and superstar Yash but also the entire Kannada film industry, into national prominence. The team has clearly made the best use of the higher budget it received after the first film\\'s success, keeping the emotional resonance from the original intact and building elaborate, well written and intelligently shot and edited mass elevation scenes that will keep you clamouring for more till the awe-inspiring climax.\\n\\nWe rejoin our hero, Rocky Bhai as he takes over control of the Kolar Gold Fields after having killed the demonic \"\"Garuda\"\" in the first film, only to have an entire can of worms open up as a consequence with everyone ranging from Garuda\\'s vengeful uncle \"\"Adheera\"\" (Sanjay Dutt) to the Prime Minister of India \"\"Ravika\"\" (Raveena Tandon) training their sights on his lucrative fiefdom. Director Prashant Neel gets his casting choices spot on with both these Bollywood biggies bringing in their A-game as menacing antagonists that hold their own against Yash\\'s sheer swag and star power.\\n\\nThe void left by legendary Kannada actor Anand Nat opting not to return to the franchise due to personal reasons was ably filled by National-award winner Prakash Raj, while the rest of the returning cast play their roles with flourish, especially Ayyappa P Sharma as \"\"Vanaram\"\", Harish Rai as \"\"Khasim\"\", Achyuth Kumar as \"\"Guru Pandian\"\" and Govinda Gowda as the cheeky \"\"office assistant\"\". Srinidhi Shetty is nondescript as Rocky Bhai\\'s love interest \"\"Reena\"\", with their romance track bordering on an extreme case of Stockholm Syndrome, being the only hiccup in an otherwise flawless mass masala entertainer.\\n\\nPrashant Neel\\'s ability to smoothly intercut the main timeline with flashbacks to Rocky Bhai\\'s childhood means that the mother character, played ably by Archana Jois, makes an even more emotionally endearing impact on Chapter 2, with the mother-son bond continuing to be the glue that holds together what would otherwise have been a shallow massy outing.\\n\\nPrashant Neel has made creating innovative mass elevation sequences an art form and with a star of Yash\\'s natural badassery and swagger as his foil, the auteur has clearly cut loose with the sheer scale and scope of his sets rising to earthshattering levels, without sacrificing on ingenuity and the ability to catch the audience by surprise. The intro sequences of our three primary characters, played by Yash, Dutt and Tandon are choreographed with pinpoint precision to evoke maximum mass impact and are custom-made to play to each performer\\'s strengths. While Neel uses Dutt\\'s eyes and hulky silhouette to portray his beastly and brutal nature, with Tandon, he resorts to using minimal hand and facial gestures to showcase the sheer unspoken power wielded by her character, inspired by India\\'s Iron Lady, Indira Gandhi herself.\\n\\nAnd what can I say about Yash that hasn\\'t been already said? Irrepressible swag, a natural coyness and obnoxious body language mean he is a natural fit as the morally ambiguous gangster and it is this very nature that adds to the unpredictability of the KGF universe with the audience constantly on the ropes, unable to guess or comprehend what the crazy mafioso will do next. Music director Ravi Basrur carries on the same rich vein as in the first part, elevating each punch sequence with layers of feeling and goosebumps, switching over effortlessly from the massy highs of \"\"Sulthana\"\" to the emotionally wrought \"\"Thannane\"\".\\n\\n\"\"KGF Chapter 2\"\" stands head and shoulders over other recent Indian blockbuster fan service mass vehicles like \"\"Pushpa (2021)\"\" and \"\"RRR (2022)\"\" because of the editing and staging prowess of its director, with seemingly unrelenting action and a narrative that constantly keeps you guessing and on a knife-edge. A mandatory theatre watch! Highly, highly recommended! And don\\'t forget to catch the post-credits scene!\"\\n\" Dimaag shut ho gaya !\\n\",10,nnk-39990,15-Apr-22,\"\\n                    31 out of 42 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

It\\'s bigger, better and more grand in the truest sense of the word! Prashant Neel knew what the fans wished for and he duly delivers. With electrifying Cinematography, phenomenal background score and a surplus of action set pieces, it\\'s nothing but an Action Junky\\'s dream come true.\\n\\nRegardless, speaking of my personal opinion on it, I did enjoy my time in the theatres, and did take a strong liking to whatever this had in its offerings; However, I wasn\\'t fully sold on it.\\n\\nHalt the hate train and just let me clarify...\\n\\nI have mainly two criticisms, one is about the forceful incorporation of romance (which was mostly counterproductive) and the other one is a somewhat loose portrayal of Sanjay Dutt as \"\"Adheera\"\". Just try to remember what Prashant Neel previously did with Ramachandra Raju as Garuda. That character, not only looked ferocious and frightening he also talked evil, acted evil, and the whole aura around him was appalling to say the very least.\\n\\nNow when it comes to Adheera, the impression is quite distinct. Don\\'t get me wrong, he still is efficient enough and Mr Dutt played the role remarkably well, it\\'s just that his character appeared more like a murderous, bloodthirsty warrior (inspired by Viking traditions) than a vicious, vile adversary against our lead protagonist.\\n\\nFor Srinidhi Shetty (as Reena); My qualms are a little different. I would not put the entire blame on her, as she did whatever the director had made her do. It\\'s her character, or the writing rather, that leaves much to be desired. On a side note, I admire what they did with Ramika Sen; she\\'s fierce, desperate and very much to the point. Needless to say, Raveena Tandon did an incredible job as well.\\n\\nLooking at how my review had gone so far, you guys might be having some doubts regarding my judgements, well, don\\'t get any wrong ideas cause I wholeheartedly appreciate the film for what it is and what it represents. And the main reason for my fondness goes to Yash aka Rocky!\\n\\nI\\'m telling you, this man is something else. I have seen lots of superstars over the years but none come remotely close to what Yash brings to the table. His magnetic personality, the specific way in which he delivers his lines, and the undeniable charisma that he possesses; it\\'s truly one of a kind, unparalleled in every sense.\"\\n\" Kannada Cinema in all its Glory\\n\",9,sujanfaster,15-Apr-22,\"\\n                    14 out of 21 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Chapter 1 not only made sure Kannada movie industry on the map, but also led to the start of filmmakers taking pan India releases seriously. This was just because of the sheer quality of dubbing, right partnerships and promotion efforts while releasing in other languages. Finally, when KGF Chapter 2 is hitting the screens 3.5 years after its predecessor the cinema lovers across India also across some parts of the world have embraced it with love. KGF is complex and detailed filmmaking at its best for a gangster action drama. Director Prashant Neel\\'s attention to detail is what makes it stand out from the rest of action/drama movies. With only 3 films under his belt in the last 8 years, it looks like he has already established his brand of filmmaking.\\n\\nWhile the first part showed us the rise of Rocky bhai after dethroning Garuda in KGF, the plot of the second part is slightly more complex and political. Chapter 2\\'s narration is almost like a biopic of an actual gangster (or should I say monster :P). The movie keeps you hooked frame by frame and almost makes you feel a part of the world of KGF. Cinematography, art direction and the background score elevate almost every scene to a different level. Adheera\\'s introduction scene involving his entry into Rocky\\'s territory starts literally by \"\"burning bridges\"\". This is just a sample of many cleverly executed scenes throughout the movie.\\n\\nThe dark sepia kind of tone with barely any colourful visuals perfectly suits director\\'s narrative. The action sequences have been executed and edited more like art and haven\\'t gone unnecessarily over the top. One of the fight scenes which is barely relevant to the plot still makes for a great watch just because of the background narration and the camerawork. The dialogue writing continues to impress, and it is one of the best I have seen in Kannada cinema in my lifetime. The songs may seem like almost a continuation of part 1 music, but the visual treatment of them makes you hum and cheer along. There is a brilliant mini recreation of part 1 in the song \\'Toofan\\' and it is probably one of the best example of Neel\\'s genius execution.\\n\\nThe KGF franchise has focused a lot on each and individual characters. Irrespective of how big/small the role is almost each of them gets a narration and introduction of their own. This turns out to be both a blessing and a curse, especially in this movie. The character arc for some roles turns out to be slightly abrupt, but I guess it is the sacrifice director must make for the optimal running time. This does not affect Rocky Bhai\\'s character and the evolution from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 is handled seamlessly. Yash\\'s dialogue delivery as Rocky will forever be a trademark of its own. Almost every line of Rocky bhai\\'s character is a punch dialogue and Yash delivers them all in style without seeming to be jarring. He brings shades of Al Pacino from Scarface at times. Sanjay Dutt as Adheera has a great screen presence as an antagonist but somehow his character lacks a strong conflict with the lead and a detailed backstory to establish his purpose better. Srinidhi Shetty does get a longer screen time and she does more than a decent job with very few lines. Her character towards the end turns out to be a bit too mainstream and I believe that was planned by the director keeping a certain section of the audience in mind. Prashant Neel has very cleverly handled Raveena Tandon\\'s dubbing and has not tried to force her lip sync in Kannada. This also serves the purpose of her being in Delhi as the Prime Minister. All other supporting characters contribute their bit to movie\\'s elevating moments. Harish Rai as Chacha is a very well written old school supporting character and hats off to the director for creating a right mix of veteran and new age Kannada movie actors.\\n\\nKGF Chapter 2 is more than just a mass entertainer. It is the perfect artistic execution of the story of a movie and credit has to be given to all its departments. It is an event to witness in one\\'s lifetime and if you are a Kannadiga, you\\'d be walking out of the theatre beaming with pride.\"\\n\" Blockbuster In Capital Letters\\n\",10,abhishekshatry,15-Apr-22,\"\\n                    14 out of 21 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Just don\\'t go watch KGF 2 just because of the hype and stuff, watch KGF 1 first..see if you liked it then go for 2nd part as this film caters mostly to young audience and die hard fans of masala films.\\n\\nKGF 2 can be easily excused for its over the top nature solely because of some terrific performances and interesting story telling. It is exactly the same storytelling like KGF 1 but director Neel takes it one step above. It is this interesting storytelling that held my attention in part 1 and even now in part 2.\\n\\nThe BGM is just earthquake inducing ..it\\'s extremely loud but it\\'s so electrifying that it elevates any scene where Yash would be present. I personally enjoyed the BGM. Dialogues are again those typical chest thumping ones from what you expect from South India. But they are hard hitting and good to hear. Especially from Yash\\'s mother.\\n\\nFilled with tons of whistle/clap worthy scenes be it Yash or Sanju baba both have got some terrific dialogues that induce whistles.\\n\\nPerformances. Everyone has done a fantastic job be it the lead or the side actors .\\n\\nCinematography and setting of this film is just top class. Definitely you can feel the green screen background at places but whats in front of that green screen is just mesmerizing. Rustic and raw looking . The mines are so well set that grayish tone and everything gives that rustic look. Highly impressed.\\n\\nClimax battle is a treat. All hell break loose. That final battle felt like I was watching some battle from some kingdom film where two kings from two kingdoms are fighting. Absolute treat for masala lovers. Fires coming out as Adheera and Rocky proceed to clash is just extraordinary to watch. Full value for money scene.\\n\\nNegatives - a section no 10/10 reviewer would tell you but I\\'ll highlight them. 1. Stretched ending 2. Some hilarious fight sequences. I am not a die hard fan of any south film so when I see such action, it definitely looks super exciting but at the same time definitely makes me laugh at least once. 3. An absolute not needed romantic song in the 2nd half that Unnecessarily increases the length of the film further which already is stretched at the end. 4. In 1st half there is a car chase sequence (that imo looked exactly like the one from the climax of Race 3 lol) . The way it is shot, in start-stop manner , didnt like it. Would have enjoyed a full sequence rather than that start-stop fashion . Also, wait, wait. There is a scene at the very last related to Rocky it looked exactly inspired from James Bond : no time to die ending sequence.\\n\\nOverall, if you are a die hard masala film fan or even if you loved KGF 1, then you cannot miss KGF 2. You pay 200rs or 1700rs for the most expensive cinema, you will feel totally satisfied.\\n\\nPS - I don\\'t glorify/ celebrate films like these.\"\\n\" Kgf chapter 2 game changer cinema in India film industry\\n\",10,senguptabittu,14-Apr-22,\"\\n                    14 out of 19 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Well arrival is such an understatement for this movie, it shreds the box office like anything you have previously seen on a big screen. I have never seen fans so anxious and crazy about a movie since Avengers finale and I have got to tell you that this is the most overwhelming movie experience I have had of any Indian Movie in cinemas ever period. People were literally shouting and cheering even before the Big title showed on the screen and it definitely marks the greatest entrance of a character in a movie. Not to mention I went to the last show possible in the theatre near me and I wasn\\'t expecting it to be houseful at midnight but God am I glad to be wrong.\\n\\nWhat I really liked about this movie over RRR recently is the inclusion of Bollywood actors ( Sanju Baba and Raveena Tandon) in pivotal roles which I felt were shoehorned in the RRR Movie but are of paramount importance here and leave their mark in style.\\n\\nThe charm and magnetic presence of rocking star Yash is undeniable and the swag \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x8e with He carries this character can\\'t be replaced with anyone else helming this iconic role.\\n\\nI was amazed to see how they pulled of such visuals and set pieces with a budget of mere 100 crore (although you do see some noticable VFX or cuts in production here and now).\\n\\nThe best thing I really appreciate about this movie is the fact that it is a sequel and a quintessential in that regard. It\\'s been so long since I have seen a sequel that completely overshadows its predecessor with such a novelty and surpasses all the expectations. While Raving about this I might add this this one is not without it\\'s setbacks (although minor) which do not bring down movie much but sure could be enhanced in the 3rd installment with some addition to the budget constraints.\\n\\nThe editing still feels a bit choppy but not as jarring to look at when compared to it\\'s predecessor where it was hard to comprehend what\\'s going on the screen no matter how hard you try. The BGM here is loud again ( not for the faint hearted) but appropriate to the story and only adds to the screenplay. The romantic angle feels forced and could have been avoided but I do understand that this one is Emotion centric at core so they had to include that and it does pay off in the end when the showdown between the two nutheads begin.\\n\\nWell I got in it for the story telling perspective and not for the action sequences but I do want to confess that some action sequences are so well choreographed that you will be left in awe especially the Kashnikov scene (you will understand when it comes). The story here is less Messier and more linear than the first one makes the backbone of this monstercoaster of a ride.\\n\\nDo watch in theatres with biggest crowd possible (you will thank me later).\\n\\nMagnum Opus of Kannada movie Industry indeed.\\n\\nVERDICT: 4.5/5.\"\\n\" what a movie mind blowing.

But it\\'s truly frustrating that so many people are rating this movie 10/10. While the movie doesn\\'t deserve higher than an average of 6.\\n\\nK. G. F. Chapter 1 was one of the best movies of Indian Cinema. It had a strong script that built the character of Rocky as well as utilized him smartly. Direction was artistic. Scenes of several different times and locations were showed in continuous slides with dialogues from different people intermingled to deliver the message in a very exotic way. Instead of telling the story linear and chronologically, it had done that dynamically with scenes at places that made those exciting as well as fun to watch. That was indeed 10/10. I\\'ve watched it 7 times.\\n\\nThis second part, however, seems poor imitation of its own first part. Immensely huge population is rating it high because of the hype created and the wait for two additional years for this movie. And for that they\\'re deeply feeling the Charisma of Rocky, which the movie has delivered well. But the truth is, many things that made the first chapter great are entirely missing here. Director have failed to use the same artistic style appropriately, and in fact, most of the movie is told chronologically. Not that it\\'s a bad thing, because most movies have chronological story-telling. But due to this the story of this second chapter became more important. And sadly, the script of this chapter is extremely poor. Numerous actions and character reactions felt absurd and unrealistic. Several character motivations were destroyed by extended details.\\n\\nRocky\\'s romance chemistry is also made extremely weaker, even though lot more time is spent on this compared to the first chapter. In previous chapter it was established that Reena had already fallen in love with Rocky. And all Rocky needed to do is ask her to go with him, as she could have become a target for hurting Rocky. Hence, her life could be in danger outside KGF. She would surely not have denied, and in fact, would have went with him happily. Doing that would have also brought him Rajendar Desai as his alliance, which would have helped him greatly. But what he did here is kidnap Reena and keep her in KGF forcefully, which resulted in her loss of her love and respect for him. What most people don\\'t understand, the positive feelings she later felt could be due to Stockholm Syndrome, which many victims of Kidnapping suffer with. Hence, whatever romance build later showed that resulted in her pregnancy was to out of affection for him but because of her desire to be loved by her Kidnapper.\\n\\nAll the villains in the movie are used poorly. Adheera\\'s character is given scary getup and personality. But his actions do not scare as much as Garoda did in first part. He\\'s told to be extremely cruel and heartless and such. And what he does in the best opportunity to kill Rocky? He wastes that opportunity himself by sending Rocky. And the reason? He wants the people to see their beloved to die in their hands. Same affect could have been achieved in a far better way, and with zero risks involved if he would have send them his dead body. Those twenty thousand people were showed to be extremely scared of Adheera already. Watching Rocky\\'s dead boy would have destroyed their morale completely. They would have surrendered as soon as Adheera\\'s army would have landed there. So, the actual reason Adheera didn\\'t kill Rocky was because the script didn\\'t want Rocky to die at the moment, and the script writers could not come up with a better idea of keeping Rocky alive.\\n\\nRamika\\'s character was wasted in a big way. Although she delivered some very good few punch-line dialogues in the movie, she was eventually showed as an idiot politician and PM of India. Why the hell would she want to bomb the entire KGF? She had sent the Indian army there. She could have brought control over those fields and continued mining gold for the government. It is showed that her intentions were to avoid releasing details of the company delivering money to everyone in her surrounding, including her own party\\'s fund. But surely this could have been done in a lot smarter way compared to bombing and destroying a land full of gold. Although the movie suggest Rocky had already mined all (or most of) gold from those lands, she didn\\'t know this. Besides, this could be wrong prediction as well. There could be more gold in that land. And after bombing that entire zone, what she did? She left he land completely, instead of working out if there was any gold somewhere.\\n\\nIn Chapter 1 there were several characters who brought some dramatic impact. There was a mad man who talked rubbish and told stories, but those stories had connections to the heroism of Rocky. There were also two elderly men who worked as leaders/elders/supervisors of the slaves of KGF. There were also other characters from the slaves, like the ones who died for saving Rocky. Presence of these characters connected the viewers with the slaves of KGF. In chapter 2, all these characters removed. A combo of mother and son was brought forth to bring some dramatic impact, but that combo failed to bring real emotions into the story, and only succeeded in delivering some unrealistic but dramatic dialogues.\\n\\nBesides the main characters, almost all other characters were useless or replaceable in the story of second chapter. Kamal, Rajendra Desai, Virat (and his companion, which isn\\'t clear what happened to him), were wasted, even though they were built character (in Chapter 1) and their deaths could have brought forth lot better drama into the story. Guru Pandian and Andrews were doing something, but not showing properly what they were doing in relations to Rocky and his operations destroyed their impact their betrayals could have impacted the viewer. It was also unclear how much Inayat Khalil was connected with Rocky\\'s operations, for which his angry reaction later on also delivered no feeling at all. The story kept going with numerous things unclear, even about what exactly Adheera was doing while recovering. Hence, the story became entirely unimportant. And be frank, the directors and writers seems to have done it intentionally. They wanted to keep their focus completely on Rocky\\'s charisma and dialogue deliveries. Which, in my view, could have also be done by keeping proper delivery of the story (as the first chapter did.)\\n\\nLet\\'s come to another issue with the script. Guru Pandian\\'s hidden actions were supposed to deliver a twisting climax surprise. As I said earlier, the unfolding of this twist failed to deliver the shocking impact this should have delivered because we were not showed his connection and attachment to Rocky and his business properly. But it also failed because several of the things happened were entirely unclear. Most importantly the no-confidence motion drama, and then the election of Ramika Sen, like how exactly DYSS later failed and then Ramika Sen then came to power. Also, the drama of that secret passage from which Rocky realized that behind everything there was Guru Pandian. And if we look closely, several of Pandian\\'s actions seemed idiocy. He had staged the attack on Garuda for which Adheera was framed, and informed Adheera of Garuda\\'s attack priorly. Now, why exactly he did that? To take control over KGF? How? When he ignited a war between Garuda and Adheera, it was obvious that one of them would have won. And whoever won would then have control of KGF, not him. Alright, he might have plans to kill the other by other means. But in that case wasn\\'t it better to have let Adheera get killed by Garuda and then kill Garuda by using an assassin (Rocky in this case)? Why save Adheera then by informing him of Garuda\\'s plan of killing him?\\n\\nNow let\\'s come to the ending. In my eyes this is the worst possible ending the writers should have come up with. Ok, KGF was destroyed. So what? Rocky wanted to become the richest man on earth to fulfill his promise to his dying mother. Technically, he had no attachment to the land of KGF. He was only interested in the gold underneath the lands. And he had already grabbed most or all of it. Now he is on a ship full of that gold. He probably has more gold than most governments in the world. What should be his action now? There are many things he can actually do. He can go to a poor country and make a deal with them, offering some or half of his gold in exchange of his placement in that country\\'s government system. He can also purchase several islands, hire an impressive mercenary army, and live like a King for the rest of his life, and die at the age of 80 as the richest man on earth. But what he does here? He goes directly to Indian Navy, and also tells them he\\'s coming to them, so that they kill him. Why is in so much hurry to die in presence of his gold? Probably he doesn\\'t have confidence on himself that he would be able to keep his gold for the rest of his life. And he doesn\\'t want to die without his gold. Duh!\\n\\nOnly reason I\\'m even giving this chapter 3 stars instead of 1 is because Rocky\\'s charisma delivered good impact at several places in the movie, which were fun to watch, along with some creative dialogues from him as well as Ramika Sen. But overall it is the biggest opportunity lost in the History of Indian Cinema. This movie surely had the potential of breaking all the records ever. It could have achieved even bigger feats compared to Baahubali Conclusion. Maybe this chapter would still do good business, because Indian\\'s are more diverted towards brainless charisma type movies, rather than realism of the stories. But honestly, anyone who watch the movies and can see through the untold parts of the movie would feel the same frustration I did while watching this chapter.\"\\n\" Perfect mass Masala movie.\\n\",9,rahulwadhwani-52617,17-Apr-22,\"\\n                    1 out of 1 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

And I already have an urge to watch it one more time very soon. The feeling you get after watching this movie cannot be evoked just by the story, script, bgm, epic scale, spectacle, gorgeous cinematography, humor, actors, or emotional scenes. They all are necessary, but more importantly they also have to blend well. KGF-2 blends them all so well that it lingers around for a long time with you.

It was far more subdued than other South Indian film industries. KGF 1 and now KGF 2 have changed all that. It is therefore a matter of immense pride for me personally to see Kannada movies doing so well.\\n\\nI watched the movie at the global premiere in UAE ... the 1150pm show, even though the next day was a working day. But, not once did I regret going to a movie at such an inappropriate time. The movie was all I expected and much more. It had a great storyline that remained true to the central theme of Rocky having a motive. Every action emanates from that and which is exactly why you constantly empathize with his character, even though his villainy was obnoxious at times. That is the strength of the writing, as you viewed the character just like the way the director aspired. This for me was the biggest strength of the movie.\\n\\nThe movie continues from where KGF1 left. All the aspirers to throne of Narachi are stunned into silence when Rocky replaces Garuda at the helm of affairs. So, to get him down, they connect with Adhira, the uncle of Garuda. The fight then is between Adhira and Rocky. You see many points where it looks like Rocky is going down to Adhira but he always has a plan up his sleeve. The culmination of that fight forms the crux of the movie.\\n\\nPrashant Neel has done an amazing job with his writing and direction. Every frame looks like a masterpiece and the dark muted tones makes the movie a visual delight. Some of the frames are simply out of this world. The casting is picture perfect including Adhira, Ramika and others. It seems they selected themselves for this role. I would recommend this movie to every cinema lover.\\n\\nThe climax is a killer and after the Kattappa Bahubali saga, this is indeed a break point to cherish. I hope the makers of KGF have a plan up their sleeve.\"\\n\" Little disappointed\\n\",6,ashishmishra-65577,14-Apr-22,\"\\n                    4 out of 12 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Thought the director might have actually improved but ohh no i was so wrong it\\'s worse now.\\n\\nThe movie starts with the entry of our Rocking Star Yash with a BGM and they Forgotted to off that BGM throught the film. BGM plays on throughout the whole movie yeah it\\'s good but after one points it\\'s just unbearable and can cause headache even during normal talking scenes there is a BGM. Then the film proceeds to have 20 more entry scenes of Yash till the end of the movie. Everyone comes praises Rocky then disappear oh gosh. The second half bores you in place of being entertaining specially during romantic scenes which you seriously don\\'t care about. The romance seems very forced just to make Rocky Bhai furious enough to kill Adheera.\\n\\nThe action sequences are just as poorly edited as the first part the most awkward is the car chase scene where it continuously blacks out for no reason dude show it clearly it\\'s a action movie after all. The action in other parts is also medicore and again fast paced with many cuts. The supporting actors are there just for the sake of it. Sanjay Dutt is wasted with very minimum screen time and no character depth at all you know already he would get defeated by Rocky Bhai easily. Raveena is decent in her role but again not much importance given to her . Plus the movie is filled with many absurd scenes which don\\'t make any sense.\\n\\nOverall the second part is even worse than first and only cinematography can\\'t save a bad film infact i founded the first part to have better colours and better frames than this. How are people calling this mess a masterpiece is beyond my understanding. It\\'s just too much to take.

This movie is a winner for that matter. The movie is bigger, better and interesting, and even more engaging that the first chapter. The lead characters are commendable in their role. Sanjay Dhatt and Raveena were well introduced in their roles, added the needed spice and interest in the movie. It\\'s amazing that a movie with this budget could hold the scale and execution in such a believable and engaging story. The narrative is well written , characters well acted, well edited, scored, mixed and produced. The movie with the budget could pull a production and execution makes a case study for the film makers as to how to execute and narrate the story. And for that matter director deserves the praise for keeping all the departments well balanced in their respective roles as a film makers. I am sure the film makers across are watching the movie with an awe and an opportunity to research how to make a movie with the scale, execution, acting and overall making of the movie. We have been hearing about a young and bright editor of the movie . I am sure everyone has an eye on him after this movie. The movie excites and eagers us for the next chapter of the great combo of Yash and Prashant\\'s next venture, and we can say the movie is a benchmark and path breaker for the Indian movie industry to learn what can be achieved with the right vision and execution as the movie has rare dull moments but lots of punchlines and treats that keeps the jaws dropping for most parts of the movie What did not work: Very few scenes come to my head as what can and needs to be changed in this movie, making it better than the first chapter. Maybe the love song could have been shortened like other songs but hey who am I to say since the movie works overall for the most part which is quiet rare.

But I must admit the sequel to the ultra-stylish KGF is far better than its predecessor. And we all how bad sequels usually turn out to be. To be honest, I didn\\'t like the first movie even one bit. But Chapter 2, I didn\\'t mind sitting through.\\n\\nChapter 2 picks up right after the events of Chapter 1. Rocky is now the undisputed king of KGF. But this position comes with its share of enemies and that include the Viking inspired, Adheera (Sanjay Dutt); Prime Minister, Ramika Sen (Raveena Tandon) among others.\\n\\nKGF has its downsides. First and foremost is the jarring BGM, which literally numbs you for a while post-movie. Then comes the poor shooting skills: despite all the arms training, Rocky\\'s men cannot hit a target. Adheera is standing front and centre; all his men get shot but Adheera gets shot once on his shoulder (a beautifully shot scene nevertheless). Rocky also sets up the biggest fan for his lady love - using helicopter blades.\\n\\nBut Chapter 2 is better in terms of its pacing. After all the setup done in the first, the sequel makes more sense. The stakes are higher, the action set pieces are more extravagant. The 19-year old editor, Ujwal Kulkarni does a very good job. Rocking Star, Yash is as flamboyant as ever. Raveena R Tandon & Sanjay Dutt are good. Prakash Raj replaces Anant Nag as the narrator (maybe they wanted a bigger star in this role). Female lead Srinidhi Shetty doesn\\'t have much to do & her Stockholm Syndrome track doesn\\'t bode too well.\\n\\nChapter 2 may cause irreversible damage to your ear drums but it is definitely a step up from the first. The final sequence on the ship seemed a bit anticlimactic and the announcement of Chapter 3 was totally unnecessary (better if they end on a high) but go for it if you love mass-y films. Rocking Star Yash\\'s 8 years of hardwork and beard maintenance has paid off.\\n\\nP. S. Find a theatre that is running the Kannada (original version) with Subtitles.

In my view, KGF Chapter 2 could not meet my expectations which was set high by KGF Chapter 1.\\n\\nThe Chapter 1 was filled with too much stories compacted in short period of time. It had got war, power, politics, diplomacy, emotions and everything else to make a movie great. But the Chapter 2 is unable to include everything in a balanced way. No doubt that there are great fight scenes with some rare cinematography ever witnessed in indian cinema. But story wise, it is too weak.\\n\\nThe character development isn\\'t also in par with KGF Chapter 1. The portrayal of villainous characters are so weak that they only seem strong in their getup and armor. There is no diplomatic play between the characters. Sanjay Dutt as Adheera looks dangerous but the movie portrayed him in a weak way. There\\'s no mind game. They just fight and and the only stronger wins. Other villains like Rajendar Desai, Shetty and Andrew who were portrayed great in Chapter 1 died of nothing. Also Adheera isn\\'t someone who was shown to be like a diplomatic and strong character. Disappointed.\\n\\nThis movie is great if you are a fan of Yash and someone who likes fights, guns, slow motions, styles and cinematography. But other than that everything seems forced inside a movie to grab the attention of the audience (which failed in my case). The movie could have been great and better that Chapter 1.\\n\\nMaybe the writer was unable to discern what made people like KGF Chapter 1.

KGF both movies are no doubt best action movies in indian cinema with list of bahubali and RRR, but Prashant neel need to learn from rajamauli on how to conclude a movie. It appears Director is under a lot of pressure of expectation. A story must make it forward naturally but here it has forced to reach a end and to cover all character. Although this movie has already made a history. I have analysed this movie on different aspects.\\n\\n1. Story: Chapter 2 is full of loopholes and forced narration. Although this story has a connection to common man but it not truely explain why a mother want his son to become most powerful man on earth but not tell any ethics ?..He just want to be powerful with no ethics and he is hero of the movie.\\n\\n2. Direction: Very confused and reaching nowhere till end occur in a forced way. Many scenes are appeared without logic and this shows director is very confused with respect to expectation from first part.(7/10)\\n\\n3. Acting: All actors have done justice to their roles but this film does not provide character justification and importance, such as Adheera. Director should give more depth to these characters but he misses.(7/10)\\n\\n4. Action: Full on best part of movie(10/10).\\n\\n5. Music & Background score: Songs are average and not good. Basrur disappoint this time. Songs from first part are better.(5/10)\\n\\nAlthough background score is good. (9/10)\\n\\n6. Editing: Could be more better and it is not smooth as chapter 1. (6/10)\\n\\nHence overall rating is 7/10 and chapter 2 is disappoinment w.r.t first chapter.

F: Chapter 2 was directed by Prashanth Neel and stars once again Yash as Rocky Bhai, the new kingpin of Kolar Gold Fields (also known as K. G. F.). Srinidhi Shetty, Archana Jois, Malavika Avinash, Ayyappa P. Sharma, Harish Rai and Dinesh Mangaluru reprise their roles from the first chapter, while Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon, Saran Sakthi, Eswari Rao and Prakash Raj are the new cast members in this sequel. Chapter 2 is definitely a step-up, compared to the last installment. It\\'s bigger and better, and the production value and action sequences have vastly improved. K. G. F: Chapter 2 is, without a doubt, a commercial film, but the difference between this movie and other Indian commercial films is that the movie relies heavily on the script. The film is 2 hours and 48 minutes long, and it doesn\\'t waste any single frame during the entire runtime. There isn\\'t one unnecessary scene that feels it doesn\\'t belong in the script. Kudos to the producer, Vijay Kiragandur for understanding and sharing Prashanth Neal\\'s vision, for appreciating this bold script and for letting Neel execute the film exactly how he wanted.\\n\\nBhuvan Gowda\\'s cinematography is probably the best one I\\'ve seen in the past few years, when it comes to Indian cinema. It\\'s evident that the crew has invested a lot in production values and set designs by just looking at the cinematography and see how detailed every frame is implemented. Every single frame is jaw-dropping and astoundingly gorgeous, and the visual effects are undoubtedly on point. Ujwal Kulkarni also deserves to be praised for editing the film as smoothly as possible and for keeping the movie thrilling and engaging from start to end. The amazing score and soundtrack by Ravi Basrur elevates the movie to a whole another level. It captures the emotions the characters go through, creates tension and increases the excitement level beautifully. The action sequences handled by Anbariv are astonishing and beyond what you could\\'ve ever imagined. It\\'s also worth to mention that the action sequences rely heavily on practical effects, and the fact that they are in the same range as Hollywood films, such as Fast & Furious, Die Hard and Mad Max: Fury Road is refreshing to watch.\\n\\nAll the cast members have delivered powerhouse performances. Yash proves once again that he is the man of the show. His dialogue delivery and the way he perform the fight choreography are magnificent. Like I mentioned in my previous reviews, it\\'s very important that the antagonist is equally as strong as the protagonist both mentally and physically to keep the film engaging. The way Prashanth Neel has structured and developed the character Adheera is excellent. Sanjay Dutt was absolutely the perfect choice for this role, and he knocked it out of the park with style. Raveena Tandon, Eswari Rao and Prakash Raj were also brilliant in their respective roles as Prime Minister Ramika Sen, Farman\\'s mother and Vijayendra Ingalagi. Archana Jois, who portrayed Rocky\\'s mother, Shanthamma, may have very little screen time compared to the rest of the cast, but she has surely delivered a phenomenal performance. Srinidhi Shetty, who portrayed Rocky\\'s love interest, Reena Desai, definitely has a lot more to do in this film, compared to Chapter 1, and she has also delivered a neat performance.\\n\\nOverall, K. G. F: Chapter 2 can easily be considered as one of the best action films India has ever produced, mainly for its technical finesse, strong dialogues, exceptional cinematography and brilliant performances.

F : Chapter 2 review : Stunning Action Packed Drama.\\n\\nMy rating : 5/5 Performances : Yash is just outstanding with his terrific performance and unleashes his amazing screen presence throughout the movie. Yash continued from where he left in KGF 1. He carried himself with the same intensity and energy. He looked stylish, raw, and rugged and costumes suited his swag and mannerisms. He showed variations in his expressions turning brutal, ruthless, and menacing at one time and humane, and emotional at other times.\\n\\nSrinidhi Shetty got a limited screen presence just like her role in the first part. However, she did full justice to her emoting well.\\n\\nSanjay Dutt looked powerful evoking fear as Adheera. Though the scenes featuring Yash and Sanjay Dutt are powerfully written, Sanjay Dutt\\'s age showed up on the screen bringing down the intensity levels.\\n\\nRaveena Tandon looked intense as a powerful politician who meant business while dealing with the anti-social elements.\\n\\nRao Ramesh as the CBI officer performed well and Prakash Raj did justice to her role.\\n\\nTechnical values : Prashant Neel drove everyone crazy with the hero elevation with mass elements in KGF1 which turned him into a national celebrity. All eyes are on him as to how he will come up in the KGF2. Prashant Neel dispelled all the doubts right from the start to the finish. He filled the entire film with heavy-duty action scenes which knocked the living daylights out of the viewers. The standout stunts included Yash\\'s introduction, the action sequence before the interval and scenes that come up after the interval, and the heavy-duty climax. The stunt choreography is sensational. In order to elevate the heroism of Yash, he even showed Sanjay Dutt in an even more powerful manner. The way he ends the character of Rocky is also impressive. KGF 2 has so many factors that will relate to the masses as Neel takes us to the world of KGF and entertains you completely.\\n\\nMusic by Ravi Basrur is a backbone for the film as the re-recording breathes life to the film and all the elevation scenes on Rocky. Audio-wise, the film has all situational songs and is passable on screen.\\n\\nBhuvan Gowda\\'s cinematography is top-notch as he presented the film superbly with his framing. The lighting setup created to showcase the dark shades in the movie is impressive.\\n\\nAnbariv action choreography is Marvelous.\\n\\nDialogues are intense and production values are grand.\\n\\nHighlights : Yash Excellent performance Elevations of Heroism Terrific Action Stunts Cinematography and Bgm Rich production values\\n\\nOverall : Terrific Monster.\\n\\n488 people found this helpful.\"\\n\" KGF 2 - Offer closes sooooon!\\n\",9,nagu-34160,17-Apr-22,\"\\n                    0 out of 0 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The movie had black out cuts during a car chase sequence and I was surprised, didn\\'t understand a thing that why on earth anyone will edit a car chase in that manner lost my patience there. Throughout the movie I saw only elevations about the protagonist, people come praise him and leave one scene after other. I had a lot of expectation from the movie I really wanted this to be a well written one. But the story lacks emotions I felt no connection towards any character in the movie. The cinematographer had only close shots he didn\\'t capture things well. The camera movements will cause eye ache during Adheera and Rocky fight one on one right after Reena\\'s death. I can go on and on and on with the flaws in the movie but I am wondering how people have become blinded and support this kind of a movie which didn\\'t have any field excelled at any level. Apart from Ananth Nag in the whole of KGF franchise I have not seen a single actor perform well. Yash was all about walking, throwing punch dialogues, I didn\\'t see him act at all. He had a straight face. The villain was weak and for god sake the costume that rocky wears during his meet with prime minister of India is the costume of Allu Arjun in ala vaikuntapuramulo. Atleast they could have changed the Color. It\\'s totally overrated and doesn\\'t deserve what it is enjoying now.

And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash\\'s screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.\\n\\nKGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky\\'s character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn\\'t really necessary).\\n\\nThe biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.\\n\\nOne thing I\\'d definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it\\'s an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022.\"\\n\" Just Hype No substance\\n\",1,akl-53535,15-Apr-22,\"\\n                    7 out of 16 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

I missed the Post Credit scene so I will watch the movie again...

But first, a recap. The first chapter was a Deewar-like story of a young boy coming to Bombay and becoming a famous gangster. And then, he is sent to Karnataka, where he becomes even more famous: he becomes the messiah of the people of a secret mining town called KGF. We met Rocky\\'s enemies like Shetty bhai in Bombay and Inayat Khalil in Dubai. We met the Indian Prime Minister, a woman whose face was never revealed, a woman who spoke of unleashing the army on Rocky while signing the death warrant of the man she considered \"\"the biggest criminal in India.\"\"\\n\\nBut the film began with a television anchor played by Malavika Avinash. She listens to the KGF story as told by a senior journalist, played by Ananth Nag - and that is the same framing device Prashanth uses in the sequel as well. There\\'s just one change. The narrator now is Prakash Raj, who plays the Ananth Nag character\\'s son. I did not realise this while watching Chapter 1, but these conversations provide two things: a breather between the hectically paced events, and they are also a small bit of spoon-feeding for the audience, because the story is so deep and dense. No, let me correct that. The story is fairly uncomplicated. It\\'s the narrative that\\'s deep and dense. And we\\'ll come to this later.\\n\\nSo what does Chapter Two have in store for Rocky? He still cares for his people, who worship him. But he wants them to mine for gold day and night. \"\"The work should not stop,\"\" he says. Why? I\\'ll just tell you that it has to do with a mother and a bedtime story she tells her son. Watch the first scene carefully, because this makes the closing images so powerful, so mythical. And between this beginning and this ending, we get a film that works at two levels. One, we get a huge action spectacle with very inventive set pieces, superbly shot by Bhuvan Gowda in dark tones that indicate that we are watching a darker sequel. And two, we get a style-filled masala movie, filled with whistle-worthy dialogue and scene after scene with twists and surprises for the audience.\\n\\nIn Chapter Two, Rocky has two new enemies: the Prime Minister, whose face is finally revealed and is played by Raveena Tandon, and a Viking-style brute named played by a terrific Sanjay Dutt. His entry scene on a burning bridge is one of the film\\'s many epic highlights. In fact, every bit of this film is epic: Yash is epic and wonderfully larger-than-life, the dialogs are epic, Ravi Basrur\\'s score is epic, and the action is epic, especially a car chase that keeps cutting to a black screen - but that is why I wished for some quiet, intimate moments between Rocky and his love interest, played by Srinidhi Shetty. We get an epic moment involving a helicopter, but we get no real idea about their relationship. Their great romance - if it is that - does not register at all. The second issue I had with the film was that the unmasking of the criminal mastermind was done too hastily.\\n\\nBut that apart, I had no complaints, and we can now talk about the narrative being deep and dense. In Chapter One, the combination of the fast cutting and slow motion created a stylised effect. We get some of that in Chapter Two as well, but Prashanth really pushes himself as a screenwriter and he also pushes his editor Ujwal Kulkarni - to the extent that every sequence plays like the legendary baptism stretch from the first Godfather. The visuals come at us very fast, but this is not just the usual quick cutting for an attention-deficit audience. This is carefully planned stylisation. Take the scene where the Raveena Tandon character is sworn in as Prime Minister. She reads out a line or two. And then we see her elsewhere, barking orders to sack the Home Minister. And then, we are back at the swearing-in ceremony. So there is a sense of playing with time. We see her in the present. We cut to her actions in the future. And we return to the present. And there is also a sense of playing with geography, because these two events are happening in two different locations.\\n\\nThis happens again and again. We have a no-confidence motion playing out in the Parliament. Simultaneously, we see a shootout. Rocky\\'s wife has a bad dream. We move to a major action set piece, after which we return to the bad dream being narrated. This closing part of this narration is one of the few genuinely emotional moments in KGF: Chapter Two, along with the opening and closing imagery. But I didn\\'t mind. The action and the masala flavour and the precision of the cuts are fantastic, and even if the story arc feels familiar, the denseness from the screenplay/editing makes it all seem new. Chapter Two improves on its predecessor: it is an epic times two.\"\\n\" Sanjay dutt and Raveena tandon ruined the movie.\\n\",8,Bingeratings,16-Apr-22,\"\\n                    0 out of 0 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Only talking vaguely and giving my own opinion without any mirch masala. =\\n\\nLet me be honest and tell you the problems. Lol --- First thing first, I enjoyed the movie. :D Now regarding problems and Over the top actions sequences and many egocentric decisions took place throughout the movie. Even the fact that life of a boy was decided by his mother,even though i won\\'t argue, but still it felt a bit forced, but i know, it\\'s not bad, kinda swayed the whole vibe for me as such things only take place when we think about villains = as in cruel treacherous villains, you know what i mean, right. As we always say, see his past is the reason for him being like that = But for Rocky i have a different feeling. He is more like a Antagonist but not a villain. It\\'s like he has that vibe and the aura. He is like a person you wanna cheer for. So i was always thinking of him as MC. But now i think he is, Anti-Hero kinda being. Which is also my favourite genre btw.\\n\\n--- Over the top actions could be a bit problematic, but they made it such a fast show of actions that it didn\\'t really bother me. I get that from the first action scene, They are not trying to show me how well he fight.\\n\\nThey are just trying to set the tone and Let people\\'s imagination run wild. Which IMO is a very good way to avoid OTT Action and at the same time having a similar impact, if nothing less.\\n\\n--- So TBH not much of a problem anywhere.\\n\\nLatest movies released like, RRR and BEAST.\\n\\nALL have problem with logic and actions were so illogical and let\\'s say done with idiocy that i was kinda sad. But still, they all did one thing.\\n\\nGiving us anime style fight scenes which you can enjoy with popcorn.\\n\\nBut still by the end i has this complaint in my mind. Like, why do this? Why your knee suddenly become allright that you can jump run, while just a min. Ago you can\\'t even walk. How can broken knee just become allright, when soldiers specifically break them and didn\\'t even gave you enough food and so on. SO it was so much, that finally i stopped my brain like It\\'s ENOUGH, just stop. See this as you are seeing anime.\\n\\nThat\\'s it.\\n\\nOTT Action was much less in BEAST. But still, fighting with sword against soldiers who are fighting with AK-47, and so on. Was so stupid. That again i stopped my brain.\\n\\n--- BUT in KGF Part 2 and even in part 1. They didn\\'t give that much of a vibe of OTT ACtion going on. Which i loved. So i must say, I love their execution.\\n\\nThat\\'s it.\\n\\nBelieve me, don\\'t go for spoilers.\\n\\nIt\\'s a great movie.\\n\\nAnd they made it a fast movie, with blood pumping all around. Adrenaline and everything will just burst. Didn\\'t get bored even for a sec.\\n\\nI got to see Rocky bhai rise, his fall, even him being egoist and even changing toward this greedy and bad person, and also see how his people tried to bring him back to his previous Rocky, only to get things worse as his enemies attack. And he lost everything. And again he rises.\\n\\nAnd as we all know, as a criminal rocky will eventually die. So no suspense in that. But still his journey was worth seeing.\"\\n\" 1st Blockbuster in the 2030 decade.\\n\",10,takshakking,14-Apr-22,\"\\n                    0 out of 0 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The protagonist though unreal resembles a multiverse where a common pneumoniac kid destined to die, can grow up to be an inhuman but still bleed driven by a weakness( his humane side )which propels him to save some if not all. Loads of review online discuss about an over the top story, and I agree but my question to them is, why do you watch a movie? To forget your present, sometimes to remember the past, and sometimes to look for the future. Why can\\'t there be a movie which talks about a resembling past (the ravina tondon performance did remind me of our own Iron Lady with all her shortcomings), a motivation less covid stricken present (where every one is confined to their own dark deep mines) and a selfless future (where your being is in commensalism with others). But just forget about all my bull sh**, watch the movie with a lovely sound track, on a Dolby sound, forget about the in-consequentialness of life, and remember the incapabilities of a father to create another Rocky (pun intended). You will get it when you watch the first half.

It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.\\n\\nThe film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back.

My friends in college says South Indian movies is all about illogical action scenes , no story , i told them before leaving , we have already proved you with Bahubali and many more . I reached home & asked my friends from hometown to come with me for the movie , they showed no interest & urged me to watch Zero , fortunately the only theatre in my hometown is showing KGF movie . So , i went to watch it alone & it\\'s better to go alone than going with friends & getting their negative words for the movie while watching .\\n\\nAnalysis :\\n\\nOnly one line for the movie \"\" Once in millennia\"\" From the screenplay to the dialogues , the movie was commendable .\\n\\nBefore the interval\\n\\nFirst half is full of action . The entry scene of Yash is amazing . Yash is doing role of character \"\" Rocky\"\" . The child actor has done his role at its best . In first half , lot of characters are introduced , you have to remember each and every actor as they have their role further in movie . The first half is story instigator with mind blowing action scenes . A small love story of Yash , and you know that any love story in South India is incomplete without action and same you will get here . In first half what i adored the most , the goosebump giving scene is the last scene before interval . I will not tell you what was that , just go and watch , and i hope you will love too .\\n\\n...........................INTERVAL.......................\\n\\nWas too much hungry , as i skipped my breakfast and lunch to come to home from college and without taking any rest , i ran to watch the movie , so bought some chips , cold drink . After interval , some favourite ads of my friends again came.\\n\\n....................................................................\\n\\nThe second half\\n\\nThe real story began in the second part of movie. I personally like second half more than the first. The second half is what makes me the die hard fan of this movie. Again a lot of dialogues , that song showing mother love for her child Rocky completely caught attention. I am waiting for the movie songs to release especially that \"\"Sultan\"\" song. The tremendous work of Yash , his superb acting skills , all are beyond imagination. The terminating part of movie is unexpected and left curiousity in the minds of audience. I think the movie ended at a phenomenal stage, if you will not watch Chapter 2 that\\'s also good , because the Chapter 1 despite leaving some suspense , can say it to be complete. But the story doesn\\'t end here. The movie is elongated for the second chapter of the movie .\\n\\nFor screenplay : 4.5/5\\n\\nFor direction : 4/5\\n\\nFor dialogues : 4/5\\n\\nOverall rating : 4/5\\n\\nReview for the movie : A Simple line \"\" Going to watch this movie again \"\"\\n\\nYes , this movie put a smile on everyone\\'s face and made everyone\\'s day . As , I already said i love the CHAPTER 1 and second part perhaps not required but i also want this movie not to end here , eagerly waiting for the CHAPTER 2\\n\\nYou can hate South Indian movies , but you can\\'t ignore the emerging Yash and KGF . Zero movie is not running well , it\\'s expected that KGF will get more screens , of Zero also .\\n\\nEdit : Some people are comparing Bahubali with KGF by saying KGF is not even near to position where Bahubali is but on being opposite to their reviews , I like KGF more than \"\"Bahubali - The beginning \"\" . It\\'s truth that KGF will be criticized and people are criticizing it too. But what can we say, it\\'s their views.\\n\\nEDIT 2 : Watched the movie for the second time , still same curiosity.\"\\n\" Mind blowing\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5 FIRE \\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5Can\\'t explain.\\n\",10,bikashbarman-63046,14-Apr-22,\"\\n                    0 out of 0 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Sanjay Dutt matches him in presence. Prakash Raj is nuanced as the narrator of the film. Raveena Tandon is impressive and you will wonder why she did not get such roles in her prime. From Rocky Bhai gaining sole control over Narachi to how he makes one quick escape to return stronger, it is one helluva ride. The visuals will linger in your memory for a long time. The team has shot at JSW sites, which gives KGF 2 the canvas of brown, grey and black. Ravi Basrur\\'s scintillating BGM lifts up the sequences and you cannot help but stay transfixed to the screen. Another star of the film is cinematographer Bhuvan Gowda. The aesthetic of KGF 2 is a lot like Mad Max: Fury Road. Prashanth Neel who is part of the writing team ensures scenes loaded with dry humour and witty dialogues. With references to nepotism and secularism, KGF 2 taps into the modern milieu.\"\\n\" Greatest of indian Film industry!\\n\",10,hackershack,15-Apr-22,\"\\n                    0 out of 0 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The KGF franchise is on a whole other level!!! The movie KGF 2 completely lives up to the hype that\\'s among the audience. It delivers a completely satisfying package of action, entertainment and drama. The Dialouges, the BGM, the cinematography; everything is just awesome. Some scenes can even be matched with hollywood action films.\\n\\nAnd of course, the story. The story is so well written and the screenplay is so good that keeps people engaged throughout the movie. Another plus point of this movie which makes it better than other action movies are the realistic elements. The story feels real, the action scenes are practical, the set pieces are real and so are the Emotions that this movie conveys. And this is the specialty of KGF.\\n\\nHats off to the director - Prasanth Neel. I had never thought that such a mass movie could be made in India. Kudos to the entire kgf team.\\n\\nThis will be my most fav action movie forever coz I don\\'t really think that any movie can replace the hype that KGF has created.\"\\n\" Agar ye nahi dekha to kya dekha 2022 me\\n\",10,shishantmahato,15-Apr-22,\"\\n                    0 out of 0 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Kudos to the cinematographer \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8f\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8f\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8f\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8f. Let me now talk about the performances of every actor. OMG!! Yash, Yash and Yash amazing performance. Apart from that, Sanjay Dutt stands out as a menacing villain in a gruesome avtaar and ofcourse, the comeback of Raveena Tandon in a short but powerful act. Brutal action, top notch performances, Stunning visuals, Heart-thumping background score and the climax makes this a must watch.\\n\\nCompletely mind blowing movie a total power packed package.

Go to this movie leaving your physics book at home to watch fantastic visuals and very quirky conflict-ions which you might not get to see in any other genre. The strong points of this movie are Cinematography, BGM, and over the top dialogues. It is hyper dramatic and loud. But that is the style of this movie . It is more like a graphic novel made with real life action setting. Definitely go and watch this movie with your gang to have a ball , chill out, experience the bloody, cool and over the top action film like you enjoy a DWAYNE JOHNSON film.
